Keeping this as a rolling to do list of sorts between sessions

 - Fix spritebatch performance issues!
   - Look at possibly caching draw commands
   - Fully implement camera to clip commands outside of camera frame
 - Refine entity loading
   - Add an entity manager??
   - Revisit the big picture plan for the structure of these intertwined subsystems
 - Rectify resizing with a camera

### Longer term:
